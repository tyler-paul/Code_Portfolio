* #Overview
This repository shows various projects that I have developed in various programming lanugages. Each project has all source code included as well as screenshots of an example usage of each project (see ExampleUsage.png). To get a project to run on another computer there is a Makefile provided for many of the projects. A brief description of each project will be given below.


* #Java Projects
	* ###Artificial Intelligence Simulation
This project simulates how a vacuum would clean a room using a best-first search approach. A GUI allows a user to select the initial location of the vacuum followed by selecting which areas of the room are dirty. Once the user clicks 'Start Simulation' the vacuum will move in the room based on the actions determined by the best-first seach algorithm.
	* ###Branch Prediction Project
This project simulates how a Two-Level Adaptive Branch Prediction scheme using a per-address branch history table and per address pattern history tables would perform on a CPU. Essentially, it simulates how a CPU would predict when a branch instruction (conditional or unconditional) is taken. Modern CPUs use such schemes in order to avoid pipeline stalls. A pdf in the project folder explains the project in more detail.
	* ###Compiler Project
This project implements the front end of a parser (a scanner and a table-driven top-down parser) for the classic expression grammar (i.e. accepting expressions consisting of +, -, *, /, and parentheses).
	* ###Developer Information System
This project manages information about software developers and software projects. Using a command line interface CRUD operations can be performed on developers, projects, and assignments of developers to projects. This project makes use of Spring Dependency Injection and is meant to show S.O.L.I.D. design principles.


* #C\# Projects
	* ###Cryptography Project
This project provides a .NET WinForms UI to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RC4 stream cipher or AES block cipher.


* #C++ Projects
	* ###Textual Video Game
This project implements a simple textual story-driven video game. See the READ_ME for information on how to play and an overview of the story.


* #Web Projects
	* ###Image Sharing Site
This site allows an admin to post, delete, and edit images. They can place the images into categories and caption them. Additionally, regular users can register themselves and write comments about images. This project is written in HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL/Javascript/AJAX and I hosted it on a LAMP server at one time. See the 'Screenshots' folder for images of the site.


* #Papers
The 'Papers' folder contains various papers I wrote for classes I took at Purdue University Calumet.
