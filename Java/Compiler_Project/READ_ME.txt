The project can be run in two ways:

1) Import the eclipse project in the folder "Eclipse_Project" in Eclipse and run the main method in the class edu.purduecal.compiler.main.Main.

2) Compile from the command line by moving to the "Source_Code" folder and running the makefile and then run the bat file "RUN.bat" to start the compiler (if on Windows, otherwise use java edu.purduecal.compiler.main.Main).

In either case, example input files are provided. One which has correct syntax and the other has incorrect syntax. When the system asks for a file to parse type either:
A) ExampleInput_CorrectSyntax.txt     
or
B) ExampleInput_IncorrectSyntax.txt
