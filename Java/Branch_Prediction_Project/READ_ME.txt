To compile the project: run the makefile (or bring the class files in the compiled_class_files folder into the working directory)

The branch predictor is called in the TwoLevelBranchPredictorPApTester.java program. To change the parameters of the branch predictor change them in that file. (Default is 512 entry BHT with 10 history bits)

Run the file with: java -cp . TwoLevelBranchPredictorPApTester or enter RUNPROJECT into the command line.

Make sure gccSmall.trace is in the working directory before running the program (unzip if the file is still zipped)
